Control Unit initializes Address Space Manager
    ASM allocates address ranges for SRAM and DRAM based on model requirements


    DMA Engine used to load model weights from DRAM into designated SRAM banks 


Input Processing Unit receives input data
    processes into patches
    embeds patches and adds positional embedding
    output position encoded embeddings to the CNoC, addressed to first transformer block





Read Flow

    Compute Unit NIC packetizes read request 
    Routers and Links route packet to Memory Hierarchy Controller via CNoC
    ATU translates addresses if needed
    Cache Coherence Module checks for cache state and consistency

    MHC retrieves data from SRAM or DRAM
    Data Packet is sent back from CNoC to compute Unit 
    Compute Unit NIC depacketizes the response and forwards data to compute Unit 



    Compute Unit Performs Computation


Write Flow 

    Compute Unit NIC packetizes write request with data 
    Routes and Links routes packet to MHC
    ATU translates addresses if needed
    CCM updates cache states and invalidates copies if necessary
    MHC writes data to memory (SRAM or DRAM)
    Acknoledgement packet sent back to Compute Unit 



Read Weights Flow 
    Similar but may involve bulk data transformer


Activation and Gradient Transfers
    Similar but may involve other compute destination




Task Scheduler
    packetizes task assignment
    Routers and Links route the packet to target Compute Unit 
    Compute Unit NIC receives and depacketizes task
    Compute Unit Begins execution

    

Sychronization
    Coordinate execution across modules 
    synchronization NIC sends sync packets   
    Routers and Links deliver packets to target modules 
    Modules adjust execution based on signals 

Resource Allocation Requests
    Module NIC sends allocation request to MAU via CNoC
    MAU interacts with Address Space Manager
    Allocation Resposne sent back to requesting module 

Cache Coherence 
    implement coherence protocol MESI 
    maintain cache directory 
    process coherence messages 


Address Tarnslation Requests    
    Module NIC sends address translation request to ATU
    ATU translates
    translated address sent back to requesting module 


DMA Engine 

    manage data movement between memory and compute units
